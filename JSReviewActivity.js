​​/*How do we assign a value to a variable?
use Let variableName = value
Const variableName = value


How do we change the value of a variable?
reassign it using let and the = operator


How do we assign an existing variable to a new variable?
equal the new variable to the existing variable


Remind me, what are declare, assign, and define?
Declare: reserves a name for the variable - uses let and const
Assign: sets the value of the variable using operator =
Define: like declaring-  implies assigning an initial value


What is pseudocoding and why should you do it?
helps plan out your coding logic using programming syntax but it's not executable


What percentage of time should be spent thinking about
how you're going to solve a problem vs actually typing
in code to solve it?
20-30% planning and 70-80% coding */


//B.
let firstVariable = "Hello World"
   console.log(firstVariable)


let firstVariable = 22
   console.log(firstVariable)


let firstVariable = 22  
let secondVariable = firstVariable
   console.log(secondVariable)


let secondVariable = "Hungry"
   console.log(secondVariable)


// the value of firstVariable is 22. Confirmed via console.log(firstVariable)


let yourName = "Monae Ann"
   console.log(yourName)
